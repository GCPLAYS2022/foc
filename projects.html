            <p>The final projectÂ will be divided into four pieces. Each part has a completion date. The course moodle site contains a detailed overview of the project. It will consist of building a github-hosted website constructed with html, CSS, and javascript. This website serves as a model for the Final Project. Project Specification can be found on the Moodle site.</p>

            <p>There are multiple projects that I've completed throughout this semester. For example, my student resume, this Final Project, and many more. There are many ways you could do your own projects like these and discover the power of this new world of technology. One of the main websites I use is <a href="https://www.w3schools.com" target="_blank">W3schools</a>.</p>
